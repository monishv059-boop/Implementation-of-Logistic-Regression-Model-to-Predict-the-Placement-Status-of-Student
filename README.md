# Implementation-of-Logistic-Regression-Model-to-Predict-the-Placement-Status-of-Student

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the the Logistic Regression Model to Predict the Placement Status of Student.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Logistic Regression
Used for binary classification (Placed / Not Placed).

2.Decision Tree Algorithm
Predicts placement using tree-based decision rules.

3.Random Forest Algorithm
Ensemble method using multiple decision trees for better accuracy.

4.Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Classifies students by finding the optimal separating hyperplane.

5.Naive Bayes Algorithm
Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes’ theorem.
